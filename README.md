# Javis
Javis:: A visual discerning, context aware, conversational assistant.

The idea is to create a set of APIs to be consumed in an accompanying mobile application. 
APIs will expose several models that are relatable to the human interaction experience, 
and thus potentially provide a discerning, context aware assistant for the user.
